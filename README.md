# 🚀 SRTF Algorithm

This project implements the **Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)** process scheduling algorithm, developed using React and Vite, with HMR (Hot Module Replacement) capabilities and configured with some ESLint rules.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- ⚛️ **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- ⚡ **Vite**: Fast JavaScript build tool with support for HMR.

## 🌟 Features

- ✅ Implementation of the SRTF algorithm for process scheduling.
- 🔄 Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for faster development.
- 🧹 ESLint configured with basic rules to maintain clean code.
- 📊 Visual representation of process scheduling for better understanding.
- ⚙️ Fully customizable through configuration files.
- 💻 Cross-browser compatibility ensuring consistent behavior across major browsers.
- 🚀 Optimized performance for both development and production builds.
